# Group_Project
When do most accidents occur and why? This is the question that we will be answering with our project.

This dataset was chosen because it holds information from February, 2016 to June, 2020. The dataset holds 
information on  million accidents, from 49 states. Weather types and conditions are also available
 in the dataset. 

This topic was selected in order to find patterns in accident occurance. 
Accident prediction and accident hotspot information are important an may help avoid fatality accidents. 

The dataset we are using is from https://www.kaggle.com/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents. The source of
information in the dataset is from API broadcast by law enforcement agencies, traffic sensors, 
traffic cameras and the US and state departments of transportation.
