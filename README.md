# Group_Project

Introduction:

The main goal of this project is for our group to collaborate and use the valuable skills we have learned. We will be utilizing remote collaboration, 
creating a database, cleaning  and extracting the relevant data, using machine learning and creating a dashbord to display our data. 
Some of the programs we will be using Postgres SQL, Python, Jupyter Notebook and Tableau during the process. 
This topic was selected to find patterns in accident occurance. Using our skills we can 
aid in the prediction of an accident, hotspot information, roadway and weather condition to help avoid fatality accidents.

Analysis:

When do most accidents occur and why?
Analyzing accidents can provide valuable information.
With this dataset we will be  analyzing and answering this question as well as including information about the weather
at the time of the accident, accident severity along with longitude and latitiude of the accident location. 
While analyzing this data we can discern accident frequencies and probabilities of accident occurance.

About the dataset:

This dataset was chosen because it holds information from February, 2016 to June, 2020. The dataset includes 
information on 3.5 million accidents, from 49 states. Weather types and conditions are also available
within the dataset. 

The dataset we are using is from https://www.kaggle.com/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents. 
The sources of information in the dataset API broadcast by law enforcement agencies,
traffic sensors, traffic cameras and the US and state departments of transportation.
