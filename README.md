When do most accidents occur and why?
Analyzing accidents can provide valuable information. With this dataset we will be  analyzing
and answering this question as well as including information about the weather
at the time of the accident, accident severity along with longitude and latitiude of the accident location. 
While analyzing this data we can discern accident frequencies and probabilities of accident occurance.

This dataset was chosen because it holds information from February, 2016 to June, 2020. The dataset includes 
information on 3.5 million accidents, from 49 states. Weather types and conditions are also available
within the dataset. 

This topic was selected in order to find patterns in accident occurance. Using data mining techniques we can 
help in the prediction of an accident, as well as hotspot information, roadway and weather condition
to help avoid fatality accidents. 

The dataset we are using is from https://www.kaggle.com/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents. The source of
information in the dataset is from API broadcast by law enforcement agencies, traffic sensors, 
traffic cameras and the US and state departments of transportation.
